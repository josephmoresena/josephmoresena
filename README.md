- 👋 Hi, I'm Joseph Moreno, an electronic engineer who has loved programming since he was a child. I'm from Colombia 🇨🇴.
- 👀 I'm interested in PHP, JS, Java, .NET but mostly NativeAOT as I'm not very good with C or C++.
- 🌱 I'm currently learning Swift because I also want to have some fun with my MacBook.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects, especially those in C#, NativeAOT and AvaloniaUI.
